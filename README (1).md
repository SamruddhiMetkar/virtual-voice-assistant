# VIRTUAL VOICE ASSISTANT

This virtual assistant, also called AI assistant or digital assistant, is an simple basic program that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for the user.


## why?
Nowadays, with the development of technology, we are preferring to speak rather than type. Almost all tasks are digitalized. We have Smartphone in hands and it is nothing less than having world at your finger tips. These days we aren’t even using fingers. We just speak of the task and it is done. There exist systems where we can say Text Dad, “I’ll be late today.” And the text is sent. That is the task of a Virtual Assistant.
